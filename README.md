# Data-wrangling-for-dashboard
Here's Python for a dashboard I created.
Some of the most extensive data wrangling I've done for a data science project was for a dashboard based on 23 files that contained all admissions for substance abuse treatment in the United States from 1992 to 2014. Each of these 41 million case reports had more than 50 variables (features). As part of the project, I combined that data with 2014 U.S. Census data to show which states had the greatest abuse rates (as a percent of population), and the three most abused substances in each state.
